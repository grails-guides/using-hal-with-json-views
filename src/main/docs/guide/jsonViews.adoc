Here's a trivial example of a JSON view:

[source, groovy]
----
json.message {
    hello "world"
}
----

This JSON view would produce the following ouput when rendered:

[source, javascript]
----
{"message":{ "hello":"world"}}
----

JSON views also support a `model` which references the data passed in to the view, as seen below:

[source, groovy]
----
model {
    String message
}
json.message {
    hello message
}
----

JSON views are Groovy files with the file extension `gson`, and they reside in the `grails-app/views` directory, just like GSP views. They are resolved (by convention) to a controller with the same name as the view directory, again like GSP views.
