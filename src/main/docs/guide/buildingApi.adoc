The default JSON rendered by Grails is a good start, but it doesn't necessarily express the details we want in our public-facing API. http://views.grails.org/latest/[JSON Views] allow us to render our data using Groovy's http://docs.groovy-lang.org/latest/html/gapi/groovy/json/StreamingJsonBuilder.html[`StreamingJsonBuilder`], in a statically-compiled Groovy view. JSON views provide a powerful DSL-based tool for expressing the JSON output from our API.
