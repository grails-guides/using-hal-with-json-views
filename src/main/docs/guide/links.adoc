Links are the key in the HAL standard. HAL resources include a special field called `_links`, which contains an array of JSON objects that define links to related resources. A HAL link contains (at least) two pieces of information - a relationship, and an `href` containing the URL to access the related resource. Other metadata can be included as well.

Here's a sample of a JSON body with a `_links` field, and two links:

[source, javascript]
----
{
    title: "Groovy Recipes",
    author: "Scott Davis",
    pages: 100,

    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/book/show/1",    //<1>
        },
        "author": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/author/show/1", //<2>
        }
    }
}
----
<1> `self` is a special link that every HAL resource should include - it specifies the URL "back" to the current resource.
<2> Here we're defining a custom link called `author` that specifies the URL for the `author` field

When a HAL resource is accessed by a client, it is possible to "browse" the relationships expressed in the `_links` field without the client knowing the exact makeup of the API endpoint.

[source, groovy]
----
//examples are using the fetch API: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API

//retrieve a book instance from the API
fetch("http://localhost:8080/api/book/1").then(function(response) {
    return response.json();
}).then(function(data) {
    this.book = data;
});

//retrieve book's author using links
var author;
fetch(book._links.author.href).then(function(response) {
    return response.json();
}).then(function(data) {
    author = data;
});

JSON views implement a Groovy trait http://views.grails.org/latest/api/grails/plugin/json/view/api/HalView.html[`HalView`], which exposes a `hal` helper with several methods for outputting HAL-compliant JSON. One of those is the `links` method:

[source,groovy]
----
model {
    Order order
}
json {
    hal.links(order)
    //...
}
----

Calling `hal.links()` on our domain resource produces the following JSON output:

[source, javascript]
----
{
    _links: {
        self: {
            href: "http://localhost:8080/api/orders/1",
            hreflang: "en_US",
            type: "application/hal+json"
        }
    }
}
----

Let's edit our `order/show.gson` view to include a `self` link as well as a link to the associated customer:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/views/order/show.gson
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/views/order/show_v2.gson[]
----
<1> The `links` method can take a domain resource instance, or a map of link names and objects to link.

Make a request to `http://localhost:8080/api/orders/1`:

[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/integration-test/groovy/com/example/OrderShowV2IntegrationSpec.groovy[indent=0,lines=31..68]
    //...
}
----
