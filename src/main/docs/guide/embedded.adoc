Let's take a look at our `Product` domain resource. `Product` has a `belongsTo` relationship with `Category`, which is expressed in our default JSON output in a simple object with the category id:

[source,javascript]
----
{
    id: 1,
    category: {
        id: 1
    },
    inventoryId: "CLOTH001",
    name: "Cargo Pants",
    price: 15
}
----

Again we'd like to make it easier for consumers of the API to obtain the category for the product. We have several options:

 1. We could simply *include the `category` details in our JSON view*: This approach obscures the boundary between the `Product` and `Category` resources in our API - it gives the (incorrect) impression to the client that `category.name` is a property of `Product`, rather than a API resource in its own right.

 2. We could provide a *link to the category*: This approach would require clients to make a new request to get the category details, and it's likely that most clients will want both the product and the category details in the same request.

TIP: You may recall that in the case of an order's `shippingAddress`, we used the first of these two approaches (including the associated object's details in the JSON view) - this is because `Address` is not exposed in our API as a resource, so an `Address` is effectively part of either an `Order` (`shippingAddress`) or a `Customer` (`address`) as far as our API is concerned.

HAL specifies an `_embedded` property to represent cross-resource relationships in a nested format. With an embedded approach, we could include the `Category` in the same HAL+JSON response, but the category would be in a separate element to make it clear that these are separate resources.

JSON views provide an `embedded` method (via the `hal` helper) that will generate an `_embedded` element in our JSON view. It will include the default JSON output for the embedded objects as well as a `_self` link for each object.  Let's use this to embed the category in our product output.

Create a new directory under `grails-app/views`, called `product`:

[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir grails-app/views/product/
----

Create a new JSON view under this directory, called `show.gson`:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/views/product/show.gson
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/views/product/show.gson[]
----
<1> We're passing `embedded` method a map of element names (in this case `category`) to objects to embed (`product.category`)

Now make a request to `http://localhost:8080/api/products/1`:

[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/integration-test/groovy/com/example/ProductsShowFuncSpec.groovy[indent=0,lines=30..54]
----

In previous code snippet, the `category` object includes the default JSON renderer output for our `Category` resource, as well as a `_self` link so clients can request the category directly if needed.

Let's use the `embedded method on the `order/show.gson` view, and embed the `order.customer` resource:

[source,groovy]
.grails-app/views/order/show.gson
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/views/order/show_v4.gson[indent=0]
----

Make a request to `http://localhost:8080/api/orders/1`:

[source, groovy]
----
include::{sourceDir}/src/integration-test/groovy/com/example/OrdersShowFuncSpec.groovy[lines=33..99]
----

Now clients of our API can access the details of embedded resources, without making additional requests.

[source, groovy]
----
//examples are using the fetch API: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API

//retrieve an order instance from the API
fetch("http://localhost:8080/api/orders/1").then(function(response) {
    return response.json();
}).then(function(data) {
    this.order = data;
});

var customer = this.order._embedded.customer;

console.log("Order ID: " + this.order.id);
console.log("Customer: " + customer.firstName + " " + customer.lastName);

//retrieve a product instance from the API
fetch("http://localhost:8080/api/products/1").then(function(response) {
    return response.json();
}).then(function(data) {
    this.product = data;
});

console.log("Product: " + this.product.name);
console.log("Category:" + this.order._embedded.category.name);
